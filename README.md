NETW-215 Group Project 
======================

What is github? 

Super quick:

Github, is a versioning system. Users can contribute basically any digital piece of data, make changes, and github does a lot of the heavy lifting in keeping things in order, saved and synced. It also allows 'blame' to be attached to the user who makes changes, so you can see where contributions come from
We're going to be using github to share any digital info we need to - docs, pcaps, Dockerfiles, etc.



Sam Caldwell has created a Dockerfile that contains a BIND DNS server for use to test while we get ready for the project. Go to the below links for the download pages and install info for (1) Mac or (2) Windows.
